For example, given the instruction \"delete all wikipedia tabs\", execute the `tabs.remove` function with `tabIds` being the IDs of all wikipedia tabs.\n\nNote:\n- if a tab has a groupId of -1, that means it is ungrouped\n- a tab is only making sound if audible is true AND muted is false.\n- A tab's status being complete means it is in memory. loading means it is still loading, and unloaded means it was complete but then got unloaded out of memory.",
